		<h2>How it started</h2><img src="https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/What-Is-A-Full-Stack-Developer-and-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-to-Start.jpg"width="62" height="62">
			
			<p>This all started when the World just started facing a Pandemic. We all were aware about this COVID 19, but it wasn't that severe here until 24th of March.</p>
			<p>Prime Minister called for a whole nation lockdown and suddenly all of a sudden we had nothing to do in our houses except for seeing this Pandemic spreading like wildfire. We were advised to sit in our houses and break the chain of this virus.<hr>
		<h2>24/03/2020. The day it all started</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Thats when i decided to pursue Web Development</p></li>
			<li><p>I downloaded the course from Udemy named "WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP : FROM ZERO TO MASTERY"</p></li>
			<li><p>And today here i am doing this course and making the First Html Website of my own.</p></li>
			<li>All i needed was a Laptop, a constant internet connecion(it can be of moderate speed) and a zeal to know about something new.</li>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong><em>I was planning to Pursue it from a very long time, but i always thought that i don't have enough time in my hand during all my college hours to start this until <strong>COVID-19</strong> happend and i was there quarantined in my house having no prior works.And that's when I felt like i had all the time in the world. So if you plan to start a course in coding, this is your time. Own this time.</em></p>
